To direct and verify the results of the software tests developed for this practice, the SonarQube software quality analysis platform has been used, 
since it is free software and uses various static source code analysis tools such as Checkstyle, PMD or FindBugs to obtain metrics that can help improve the quality of a program's code.
The idea is to manage the code of practice through this platform to obtain different metrics that help us focus the development of the tests. Through data such as code coverage, the cyclomatic complexity of the methods etc.
